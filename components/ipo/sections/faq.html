                <p>IPOs provide an opportunity to invest in growing companies at an early stage. If the company performs well, the value of your shares can increase significantly over time. IPOs also offer the potential for listing gains, where shares are immediately worth more on the stock market than what you paid during the IPO.</p>

                <p>IPO investments can be risky as the company has no trading history in the public market. The stock price might be volatile in the initial days. Also, there's limited information available about the company compared to established listed companies. Sometimes companies may be overvalued during IPO, leading to potential losses for investors.</p>

                <span class="toggle-icon">+</span>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>IPO returns are calculated by comparing the IPO allotment price with the current market price. The formula is: ((Current Market Price - IPO Price) / IPO Price) Ã— 100. This gives you the percentage return on your investment. For listing day returns, replace the current market price with the listing day closing price.</p>

                <span class="toggle-icon">+</span>

            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Yes, you can apply for an IPO using a sweep-in/sweep-out savings bank account. The ASBA mechanism only blocks the required amount in your account until allotment, so as long as the funds are available when needed, the sweep feature won't affect your application. Just ensure sufficient balance is maintained in your account until the IPO allotment process is complete.</p>
